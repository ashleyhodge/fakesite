# Fake Site

## Description
Fake Site is a fake website made to showcase my skills as a frontend developer in Next.js and React.js. For this site, I was given instructions to use a mockup and style guide as reference. I followed these references as best I could while also making the application responsive and user friendly.

## Demo

# Technologies Used
For this project I used: 
- NextJS
- ReactJS
- Javascript
- React-Player
- Bootstrap-React Component
- Tailwind CSS
- CSS

## Challenges
Using Vimeo API: 
- I spent most of my time working with this API trying to understand the documentation and the implementation using NextJS, but unfortunately I was not able to get it working before the deadline. I will continue working on this until I fully understand and am able to use this API in my application.
  
Carousel Component:
- Styling this component was difficult due to the use of a new technology - React-Player. Although the instructions stated not to worry about using a video player during this application, I decided that using on would give me the chance to show my ability to learn something new in a limited time frame. It was a difficult challenge to overcome but in the end I made it work.

CSS Framework: 
- I am aware that it is not best practice to use more that one CSS framework in a single application. However, because this project was made specifically to show the skills I have to offer, I decided to do so. You'll notice that for most components I used basic CSS, while in the VideoSection I also used a Bootstrap-React component, and in the Directory and Footer components I used Tailwind.css. The challenge here is not knowing if this was the best option and over thinking.

## Future Developments
As of August 8, 2022 there are still a few components that I will continue developing for this application. They are:
- login/sign up page
- Single Video page
- Dropdown menu for account and account page
- About Us Page
- User Profile Page
